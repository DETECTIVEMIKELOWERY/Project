                <h2>Learn Scala</h2>
                <p>SCALA:- Scala is a Java-based Hybrid programming language. It combines the features of functional-oriented and object-oriented programming language. It is used by integration with the Java Virtual 
                    machine and can compile the written code.
                     Apache Spark is a lightning-fast cluster computing designed for fast computation. It was built on top of 
                    Hadoop MapReduce and it extends the MapReduce model to efficiently use more types of 
                    computations which includes Interactive Queries and Stream Processin</p>

                 <h2>Learn JavaScript</h2>
                 <p>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.JavaScript is easy to learn. This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.
                    JavaScript is a client-side scripting language developed by Brendan Eich.
                    JavaScript can be run on any operating systems and almost all web browsers.
                    You need a text editor to write JavaScript code and a browser to display your web page.To start with, you need a text editor to write your code and a browser to display the web pages you develop. You can use a text editor of your choice including Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom or any other text editor you are comfortable with. You can use any web browser including Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer etc. </p>

                 <h2>Learn PHP</h2>
                 <p>PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. 
                    It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
                    PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.
                    PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time. PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible. PHP Syntax is C-Like.</p>

                <h2>Learn Java</h2>
                <p>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.
                    Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)
                    The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
                    Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.
                    Java is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java-based), desktop applications, web applications, client-server applications, enterprise applications, and many more.
                    When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things which may lead to bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.
                    When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are written in Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, but Python does not.</p>
